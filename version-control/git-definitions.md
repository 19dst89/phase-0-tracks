# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

	Version control is a tool that allows you to view different revisions to files and then merge together those revisions made by you and/or other people. It is useful because it allows you to go back to a previous version very easily if a bug or major issue came about, as well as allowing multiple people to coordinate and split the work on a single project.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

	A branch is basically a copy of the current project. The main reason you would use a branch is too add code and/or files to the project and make sure it all works properly before merging it into the master branch.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

	A commit is a save point for your project allowing you to go back to that point at anytime. A good commit message is very detailed and explains what was changed since the last commit.

* What is a merge conflict?

	A merge conflict is when there is a problem merging the updated branch into the master branch. Most simple conflicts will be automatically resolved such as a modified text file in the updated branch.
